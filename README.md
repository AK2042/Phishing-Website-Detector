# Welcome to the Phishing Website Detector Project

The project developed by us is a phishing link detector

## What is a Phishing Link?

Phishing links take users to impostor websites or sites infected with malicious software, also known as malware. 
Malicious links can be disguised as trusted links and are embedded in logos and other images in an email. From these
links, the information and files in the user's device gets compromised.

Keeping this in mind, we decided to develop a website which detects if a particular link is a phishing link
or no. 

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (Frontend)
